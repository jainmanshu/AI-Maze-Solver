# AI-Maze-Solver

Crafted a randomized Maze Solver in a Java IDE environment, visually representing mazes using the Java StdDraw external library. The solver employed diverse algorithms such as Depth-first Search, Breadth-first Search, A* search, and Dijkstra algorithm. This project aimed at deepening my understanding of pathfinding in Artificial Intelligence.
